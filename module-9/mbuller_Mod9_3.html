            <h2>Chapter One</h2>
            <p class="intro">My name is Mason Buller. I am 21 and from Lincoln, Nebraska. I started studying computer science at my local
                community college where I majored in Applications Development. I took courses in <span class="sentence">HTML and CSS, Java, <span id="JavaScript">__________</span>,
                C#, Visual Basic, Python, and SQL.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, in my free time I've enjoyed going out with friends, crocheting, and watching cooking videos. On YouTube I like to 
                watch videos where chefs recreate popular <span id="snacks">_____</span> that you'd typically buy. I also like watching food videos on TikTok.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also like to spend time with my cat, Willow. She is a <span id="Ragdoll">______</span> mix and 10 years old. She spends most of her time with me in my room or just outside my door.
            </p>
            <p>My goal after completing my Software Development degree is to potentially pursue a Master's Degree. Georgia Tech has an online master's program
                in computer science. I think it would be really interesting to continue my studies and potentially incorporate more math into my work.
